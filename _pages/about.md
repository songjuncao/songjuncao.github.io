## Brief Bio
<!--![ref](https://songjuncao.github.io/files/gongzhonghao.jpg) -->

My research interests include speech understanding, speech generation, multi-modal and LLM. I have been trying to deal with the real products' challenge while maintaining interest in the academic research work.
<!-- I may write something once in a while. If you are interested, just scan the above QR code with wechat and follow my **WeChat Subscription**. -->
<!--One of my ambition is to **gracefully** solve products' challenge with **new algorithms**.-->
<!--**I am looking for highly-motivated people to collaborate or for internship**. If you are interested, just send your CV to xmdxcsj@gmail.com.-->
